\f0\fs24 \cf0 The file XXX is a afni proc script based on the output of CG\'92s py script.  It was tested on QUEST and is a response to a problem the afni had finding its templates on QUEST.  A template folder was made in our QUEST projects folder and the path has been added to the afni proc.  The XXX script is the tcsh output of XXX.  \
\
The py script should be modified to add the path included in the afni proc script XXX.  \
\
\
For iNets 003 and 006 the all sessions model was implemented via Mixed_All_Runs_3tasks.sh (well really its corresponding tcsh Mixed_All_Runs3tasks_Orig.tcsh)\
\
\
Each individual session was modeled with Run_By_Session.tcsh but some strange white space error prevented from moving on to runs 2 to 4 so Run_By_Session2to4.tcsh was used for runs 2 to 4.  \
\
After the session level models were completed Session_Contrasts.tcsh was run to extract the coefs for the contrast of interest then to run single sample t tests to convert to atlas space and then to convert the t stats to z stats.  \
\
EXPR_Test.tcsh was used to test the box car implementation of the sustained signal.  Polrot2TestSession1.tcsh was used to test the model with only polrot of 2.  }
