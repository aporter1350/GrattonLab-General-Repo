%%% README - how to run fmriprep for lab preprocessing on Quest
% Edited: 02/11/2020 by CG

Steps:
1. Make sure you have singularity on Quest in version you want (should only need to be done occasionally)
    > module load singularity
    > singularity build /projects/b1081/singularity_images/fmriprep-$VERSION.simg docker://poldracklab/fmriprep:$VERSION
    (if this doesn't work, you may need to add some files to your bashrc path. Talk to Caterina)

2. Get data onto quest: use a version of the mirror_boxfiles script in my home directory (/home/cgv5452/mirror_boxfiles) to do this; based off of instructions for moving data between Quest and Box made by Brian and stored in our Box Lab Wiki documents. We'll probably run one subject at at time to limit storage needs on quest.
Example call:
   > ./mirror_boxfiles DATA/iNetworks/BIDS/Nifti/sub-INET006/ /projects/b1081/iNetworks/Nifti/sub-INET006/

3. If you want to reuse a previous freesfurfer run, make sure that run is linked into the top level freesurfer directory (/projects/b1081/iNetworks/Nifti/derivatives/freesurfer-6.0.1)

4. Start singularity in a terminal on quest
   > module load singularity

5. Run fmriprep through lab command.
   > sbatch fmriprep_batch_script_1.5.8_MOD5.sh
Before starting, edit the sbatch commands as needed (remember email!) and also the inputs that are being given (i.e., subject ID, freesurfer path, working directory path, etc.)
This takes ~1 day with the current settings on an iNetworks subject. Monitor progress through slurm output files and by looking at qstat list.

If freesurfer has not been run expect this will take ~ XXX hrs

If you want any other version, check the following documentation and edit fmriprep command as needed:
https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

6. Once done, check that fmriprep completed successfully:
- check html output for errors
- check that output files have been saved in derivatives directory
- look through html file for QC (see list)

7a. If all looks good, transfer data back
??? Haven't set this up yet... some version of mirror_boxfiles presumably.

7b. If something didn't work, troubleshoot through output file and error in html file:
- is a path wrong or missing?
- is the data inaccessible in some way?
- if not obvious, try rerunning fmriprep command with same working directory to see if it will move further (occasionally works, but suspect. Note this occurrence)
