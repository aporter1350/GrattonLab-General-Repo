\f0\fs24 \cf0 The file PreProc_PathtoBase.sh is a afni proc script based on the output of CG\'92s py script.  It was tested on QUEST and is a response to a problem the afni had finding its templates on QUEST.  A template folder was made in our QUEST projects folder and the path has been added to the afni proc.  The proc.preprocAFNI.sub-INET006.sess-1_PathtoBase script is the tcsh output of PreProc_PathtoBase.sh .  \
\
The py script should be modified to add the path included in the afni proc script PreProc_PathtoBase.sh.  }
